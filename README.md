This is shared in the hope that it may be useful to somebody else.

At this point it is probably non-functional, as it is written for an old
version of Swift and hasn't been tested in a few years. But the last time I
visited the project it was working well enough for my wife to use as her
primary player.

It attempts to create a music player with a more sensible shuffle algorithm
that won't repeat tracks until the complete collection is exhausted.

Apple's shuffle algorithm is a simple random selection that makes no attempt to
avoid repetition.

Please use and share freely, but I would not mind hearing about things that get
built with it. Please consider emailing mixtery@wijjo.com.

I might also suggest double checking that the included image resources are free
to redistribute. I believe I chose ones that were, but again, since it's been a
long time I would make extra sure that is true.

Cheers!
Steve
